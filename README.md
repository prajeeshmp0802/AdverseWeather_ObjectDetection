# AdverseWeather_ObjectDetection
MSc Thesis: Object Detection Under Adverse Weather Conditions using YOLOv3

This repository contains the code and resources for my MSc thesis focusing on object detection algorithms under adverse weather conditions. The project uses the YOLOv3 object detection algorithm and evaluates its performance on synthetic rainy images based on the KITTI dataset.
